The second set of equation is a single equation which models the transport of the truncation error.\n",

When we now work with the truncated moment equations, which model radiative transfer for frequency bands up to order $N$, we will have additional energy from the interaction of higher frequencies with the medium being injected into our system for lower frequencies. This injection is modeled by an additional source term: the deviation term. The most popular example for this is optically thick media with a large scattering coefficient. Here the radiance distribution becomes close to isotropic, hence energy is redistributed to lower frequencies.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is interesting to relate the diffusion-correction closure to the closure problem of the diffusion approximation and variable eddington factor(VEF) approximations (see report version 5, chapter 2.2 on $P_1$ moment closure).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the report, the moment problem is defined as finding an expression for the $N+1$-moment of the radiance field distribution (in angular domain). This is because the moment expansion equations truncated at order $N$ depend only on the moments up to order $N+1$. This can best be seen in the *matrix M section* in the notebook starmap_extensions_arte_study.ipynb. The directional derivative term causes a block-tridiagonal structure with an empty main block-diagonal and it can be seen that the coefficients of band $l$ depend only on coefficients up to band $l+1$. It is important to note, that this dependency is broken, once we have an anisotropic medium.\n",
    "\n",
    "For different diffusion closures (such as VEF), an assumption on the radiance field distribution was made, of which its moment $N+1$ (under further assumptions and simplications) was expressed in terms of the moments $< N$. Inserting this derived moment led to non-linear diffusions coefficients and a variety of diffusion theories. The closure problem for diffusion theories therefore was defined as finding an expression for the $N+1$-th moment of the radiance field distribution in terms of the $N$ moments.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the diffusion-correction discussed in this notebook, the closure problem is defined from a different perspective. Instead of defining a missing moment in terms of known moments, based on assumptions about the local radiance field distribution, the RTE is extended with a deviation term, which models the interaction of the truncation error with the medium. A coupled set of equations is being derived which still fully models correct light transport, without any truncation error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between diffusion closures and the closure derived here is, that for the former, it was all about constructing a moment for the next higher band above the truncation level, while the latter is about finding a good approximation for all higher bands using the deviation equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since for isotropic media, truncated moment equations only depend on radiance field of order $N+1$, both closure perspectives end up doing a very similar thing. In the report we have seen that VEF-closures depend on aggressive simplifications and assumptions and we see something similar in the derivation of the expression for $\\tilde L$."
