    "\n",
    "A 3D version of starmap actually exists, but is not open source. However, extending starmap for 3D problems appears rather straight-forward. The 2D version already solves the general 3D equations. The difference is, that in the 2D version, all moment coefficients for which $l+m$ are odd vanish in the solution vector. Therefore respective rows are left out in the matrices $M_x$, $M_y$ and $S$ and also in the moment coefficients for the phase function. Extending the 2D starmap code to 3D requires the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do not drop the coefficients for which $l+m$ are odd from the solution vector and from the matrices $M_x$, $M_y$ and $S$. These matrices now will also model the dependencies on x- and y-derivatives of these new coefficients.\n",
    "2. Introduce the complex-valued matrix $M_z$ (and its real variable pendant $SM_zS^{-1}$) by considering the $\\partial_z$ term in the derivation of the SH moment equations. This new matrix defines the dependecies of moment coefficients on z-derivatives from other coefficients.\n",
    "3. Introduce a new staggered grid location at the z-edge of the voxel and adopt the staggered grid generation code accordingly.\n",
    "4. The zero moments for $\\sigma_a$ and $\\sigma_s$ now need to be computed for the new grid locations as well.\n",
    "5. During time stepping, we now need to compute the z-derivatives of all solution grids (which live at different staggered grid locations) and also the x- and y- derivatives of the grids at the newly introduced staggered grid location.\n",
    "6. We need to substract $M_z\\partial_z\\vec{u}_k$ when computing $\\vec{u}_{k+1}$.\n"

    "##### The scattering term (simplified)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we do the SH-expansion of the scattering term of the ARTE. Without loss of generality, we simplify the term by folding the anisotropic scattering coefficient $\\sigma_s(\\vec{x}, \\omega)$ into the phase function $f_p$. The scattering term is then given as:\n",

    "Here we face the problem of an integral over the product of the fully anisotropic phase function $f_p$ and the directional-dependent radiance field $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the general procedure for the moment expansion, we would first like to replace each quantity ($f_p$ and $L$) with its spherical harmonic expansion. In the starmap paper from Seibold, the fact that the phase function was rotationally invariant was crucial, because it allowed to express the integral as a convolution of the radiance field with the rotationally symmetric phase function. This convolution in turn could be expressed as a product between SH coefficients (see scattering term derivation in spherical_harmonics_method.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now in our case the phase function is not rotationally invariant anymore. Therefore, the integral in the scattering term does not easily collapse to a product between SH coefficients. To get a handle on the problem, we first need to represent the phase function in terms of SH basis functions.\n",

A problem very similar to ours, with the only difference that our domain is the full sphere, not only the hemisphere, and our phase function does not satisfy reciprocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us write the phase function $f_p( \\omega_i,\\omega_o )$ in terms of incident direction $\\omega_i$ and outgoing direction $\\omega_o$. Now if we hold $\\omega_i$ fixed, the phase function reduces to a spherical function, which can be easily represented in SH:\n",

Since $M_s$ is diagonal, the matrix exponential is simply found by taking the exponential of each entry of the main diagonal (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential#Diagonalizable_case)). In our case, $M_s$ is not diagonal. Computing the exponential then becomes more difficult and is often done using some approximation technique (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_exponential#Computing_the_matrix_exponential)). However, even if this is more involved, it could still be done in a pre-processing step for non-time dependent problems."
