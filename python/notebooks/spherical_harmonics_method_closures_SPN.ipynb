The equations have the nice property, that the number of equations increases linearly with truncation order $N$ (not $N^2$ as with the general $P_N$ equations). Further, the coupling between moments has a very simple structure. These nice properties go away once the general $P_N$ equations for three-dimensional geometry are considered.\n",

    "#### Discussion\n",
    "- Generally, $SP_N$ is reported to give better results than diffusion based techniques while still being simpler and more elegant than the full $P_N$ equations.\n",
    "- The unknowns of the $SP_N$ equation can not be treated like the moments of the radiance field. Therefore, there is no expression for the radiance field based on the $SP_N$ unknowns $L^l$. [This article](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00411450.2010.535088) mentions this problem on p.82 (first paragraph). It appears that for other, more formal derivations, such an expression can be retrieved.\n",
    "- $SP_N$ can give worse answers than diffusion (last paragraph on p.75 in the aforementioned report) if...\n",
    "    - ...the problem is not close to diffusive regime (this is why SPN is used only with problems where optically thick medium dominates). This means that $SP_N$ should also have problems with vacuum scenarios.\n",
    "    - ...problem is not locally 1d\n",
    "- SPN equations are an asymptotic approximation to the transport equation (similar the way, diffusion is)\n",
    "    - away from the asymptotic limit, there is no guarantee for accuracy\n",
    "    - in some special cases though, it can be shown that SPN equals the PN solution which is known to converge"
