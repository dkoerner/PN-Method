    "<h2><center>Meeting Minutes - 06/20/17, RWTH Aachen University with Martin Frank and David Koerner</center></h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This meeting was a follow up from our email conversation on the use of starmap in the context of computer graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Talk\n",
    "\n",
    "At the beginning, David Koerner gave a talk which was attended by ca. 15 people from Martin's group and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "- First two parts of the talk were about his two research papers (Subdivivion next-event estimation, Flux-limited diffusion)\n",
    "- this was embedded into some notes on current trends in light transport simulation (such as path guiding etc.)\n",
    "- the last part presented the work from Wenzel Jacob on anisotropic radiative transfer and finished with a section on the implication of a fully anisotropic medium on the matrix structure in starmap and other challenges, such as steady state and vacuum regions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "After lunch, some people from the group joined for some in-depth discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion was joined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Dr. Kerstin Küpper](http://www.mathcces.rwth-aachen.de/5people/kuepper/start) (Associated fellow at the Aachen Institute of Advanced Study in Computational Engineering Science)\n",
    "    - works alot with starmap and is kind of in charge with the code\n",
    "- [Dr. Hossein Gorji](http://www.mathcces.rwth-aachen.de/5people/gorji/start) (Postdoc)\n",
    "    - joined because of some interesting thoughts on multi level monte-carlo, which came up during the talk\n",

    "    - works on minimum entropy methods for uncertainty quantifiation\n",
    "- two more people of which the name wasn't remembered\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- addressed some general questions which were expressed during the email conversation prior to the meeting\n",
    "    - what do one looses when using SPN in comparison to PN?\n",
    "        - SPN does not converge when the number of moments go to infinity (there is some bias)\n",
    "            - however, the limit is reached very quickly after a short number of iterations\n",
    "            - Martin showed me a PhD thesis which did a study on the error\n",
    "                - reference needed p. 80\n",
    "                - the plot showed that SPN error would drop quickly, but approach some error > 0 asymptotically\n",
    "        - Martin also mentioned that, very roughly speaking, one could say that SPN is basically throwing away some coefficients in PN\n",
    "        - it was also confirmed, that SPN can give results which have an approximation error which is worse than PN\n",
    "        - but in some scenarios, SPN is giving the identical result to PN, such as:\n",
    "            - an isotropic, inhomogeneous source\n",
    "            - others, which weren't discussed\n",
    "        - it was unclear, weather SPN works well in vacuum regions\n",
    "            - in one of the emails, it was mentioned that SPN potentially works well with vaccum\n",
    "            - in the literature, one finds that SPN is said to only work well in the diffusive regime (similar to diffusion)\n",
    "                - for example _\"Although there is a theoretical foundation for the SPn equations,\n",
    "these equations are not effective for solving all types of\n",
    "transport problems. As the derivations below will detail in a more\n",
    "precise fashion, if the problem is not (1) “close” to diffusive or\n",
    "(2) locally 1-D, SPn can give answers worse than diffusion\"_ ([from here](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00411450.2010.535088?journalCode=ltty20))\n",
    "        - we concluded that this is something which is best found by doing some studies with vacuum regions \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- current ideas/challenges for the use of starmap in computer graphics context:\n",
    "    - Support for anisotropy\n",
    "        - Martin explained, that the use of exponentials was motivated by the fact that the asymptotic preserving property (AP-property) should be retained. \n",
    "        - Other methods can also be used for the time integration, such as an explicit euler. In that case however, the AP property may not be retained and a limit on spatial- and time steps may be introduced.\n",
    "        - The problem that C needs to be stored per voxel is also present in starmap.\n",
    "    - Steady state\n",
    "        - Martin mentioned, that the differential matrix equation could be solved if we just neglect the time derivative term (one can build a solution method for that). He briefly described how such a method could solve for even coefficients. These then would be used to find the values for odd coefficients. \n",
    "            - Kerstin noted, that the boundary condition are very important and for steady state solves will likely become unstable. If we use zero-value BC without any light being emitted from the boundary into the domain, it may work.\n",
    "    - Support for vaccuum regions\n",
    "        - we discussed that SPN and maybe other closures should tested with vacuum regions in order to get a better understanding about how well the different closures work with vacuum\n",
    "        - other methods are much better suited for problems containing vacuum, such as least-squares PN or minimum entropy methods\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- general exchange on current and alternative methods/approaches in neutron transort and light transport in computer graphics\n",
    "    - least-squares PN\n",
    "        - Martin mentioned that he has investigated or wants to investigate this method for his research\n",
    "        - he briefly mentioned something related to a matrix, which needs to have a non-trivial kernel. This is violated in vacuum with pure transport and least-squares PN addresses this somehow (his explanation was good but I didn't get down the details)\n",
    "        - the problem with least-squares PN is, that it is not energy-conserving and therefore approximative, which is a big deal for neutron transport. This is why it is not used much. Maybe it can be applied in graphics.\n",
    "    - source iteration\n",
    "        - recently I learned that lambda iteration is a method, which is very popular in astrophysics codes these days for radiative transfer computation (see chapter 4.4 in [this document](www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/lectures/radtrans_2012/Chapter_4.pdf)). I asked if this method is also used or known in neutron transport. It may be the case that it is known under source iteration in neutron transport.\n",
    "    - Martin asked about the importance of non-classical transport in graphics. I told him that it is not very popular, but I felt I couldn't give him a satisfactory answer.\n",
    "    - Martin mentioned, that currently high-order/low-order methods (HiLo methods) are a hot topic in neutron transport.\n",
    "        - the rough idea is to describe transport with some PDE (such as diffusion), but use a different method for computing the flux between neighbouring grid cells/voxels (e.g. use Monte-Carlo to compute the gradient from diffusion equation)\n",
    "            - low order: diffusion; high order: monte carlo\n",
    "    - I asked, how popular lattice boltzman methods are in neutron transport. Martin mentioned, that those were not very popular, since they always contain a diffusive term and therefore are better applied to problems with viscosity (such as fluids)\n",
    "    - I asked about multi-grid methods in general for transport problems in neutron transport\n",
    "         - Martin mentioned a paper, which showed that in order for multi-grid methods to work, the operator needs to contain some diffusion\n",
    "         - since our proplem potentially has no diffusion, applying multi-grid in general could be tricky\n",
    "     - on the other hand, Martin mentioned that people will certainly have tried multi-grid with PN and that there should be some related work\n",
    "    - Gorji mentioned, that [this paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2792355) combines moment methods with variance reduction techniques\n",
    "        \n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "My impression was, that there is a lot of common ground between our research and that there was a lot of mutual interest into problems and methods from both fields. We agreed to keep in touch and the plan is, to give an update once we came across something useful. We were both interested in seeing this exchange move forward to something concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action Items\n",
    "\n",
    "- Martin offered to send us some further references for some of the topics we discussed\n",
    "- We will now go through the material and digest all the input. In particular, we want to learn about the different methods and their trade-offs. Maybe there is a better method for our purpose than PN.\n",
    "- Martin also offered us to use their 3D code of starmap. \n",
    "- Kerstin offered us to help with further advice on how to implement stuff in starmap, in case we would want to do tests (such as the steady state implementation for example)\n",
