    "This notebook summarizes filtered $P_N$, a variation to the $P_N$-approximation which was introduced in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/0907.2099) for two-dimensional problems and has been extended to three-dimensional problems in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.1634.pdf).\n",

    "The filtered $P_N$ method helps with Gibbs phenomen occuring in $P_N$ simulations with high density gradients. In those cases, the $P_N$ solution produces negative results which go away (or are reduced) with $FP_N$. The following images compares $P_5$ (left) against $FP_5$ (right). The gray areas in the left image are clamped negative results:\n",

    "The core idea behind $FP_N$ is to introduce an additional scattering term with a highly forward peaked phase function $f$. Since it only depends on the scattering angle, it can be understood as a filter which is applied to $L$. The general idea has some similarities to mollification methods in computer graphics.\n"

    "The SH projection finds coefficients $L^{lm}$, such that the mean square error between the radiance field and its truncated expansion $L_N$ is minimized. However, this minimization does not take the gradient of $L$ (in angular domain) into account (see chapter 18.20.3 in [this book](http://perso.uclouvain.be/alphonse.magnus/num1a/boyd01.pdf)). This gradient can be significant due to shadows etc. Therefore, the expansion can have high oscillations in angular domain represented by high values for higher order coefficients. These oscillations will be advected by $P_N$ through space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind $FP_N$ is, to apply a filter to the radiance field, which smoothens out higher angular frequencies. This is done by applying a convolution with a filter function. We know that a convolution can be expressed as a dot product between SH coefficients of the filter function and the radiance field.\n",

    "In order to derive the $FP_N$ equations, the filtered expansion $\\hat L_N$ is substituted for $L$ in the isotropic RTE, which is then projected into SH (by multiplying with $\\overline{Y^{lm}}$ and integrating over solid angle). Letting $\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0$, we arrive at the final $FP_N$ equations (see p.12 [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999113001125) for details):\n",
